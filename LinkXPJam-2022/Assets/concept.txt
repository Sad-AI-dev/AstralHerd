THEME: Guardian/Keeper

-- idea 1: --
AI are drawn to a central object (gate, pillar, whatever)
player knocks enemy back to kill them

waves get harder

gameover when enough damage is done to central object.

-very basic
+experience, easy


--idea 2: --
platformer, collect pieces of shattered seal,
combine all to pieces to 'win'

can't attack, only 'guard' and parry?

-not very fun -> try to come up with a more fun mechanic
+unique..?

--idea 3:--
protect a fleet of [things], enemies try to kill them.

player can boost and shoot enemies, trying to keep as many of the [things] alive.

+semi interesting
-not terribly fun



--idea 4 (3 + 1)--
idea 1, but the central object is a fleet of [things]
